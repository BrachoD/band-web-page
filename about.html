            <p> Evanescence is an American rock band founded in Little Rock, Arkansas in 1995 by singer and musician Amy Lee 
            and guitarist Ben Moody. After recording independent albums, the band released their first full-length 
            album, Fallen, on Wind-up Records in 2003. On the strength of hit singles "Bring Me to Life" and "My Immortal", 
            Fallen sold more than 17 million copies worldwide, and won the band two Grammy Awards out of six nominations. 
            A year later, Evanescence released their first live album, Anywhere but Home, which sold over one million copies 
            worldwide.</p>
            <p> The lineup of the group changed several times over the course of their studio albums' productions and promotions: 
            David Hodges left in 2002, co-founder Moody left in 2003 (mid-tour), followed by guitarist John LeCompt and drummer 
            Rocky Gray in 2007, and Terry Balsamo in 2015. As a result, none of the band's five studio albums feature the same 
            lineup.</p>
